1- The DOM- the document object model, is an interface to web pages.
It is essentially an API to the page, allowing programs to read and manipulate the page-
content, stucture and style.

 -document.getElementsByTagName(name)
 -document.getElementsByClassName(name)

3- Asynchronous requests will wait for a timer to finish or a request to respond
while the rest of the code continues to execute.
When the time is right a callback will set these asynchronous request into action.

4- The sources tab in Chromes Developer Tool will allow you to see all of its content on the site,
all its elements and script.

5- JavaScript promise is an object that may produce a single value some timr in the future.
Either a resolve value, or a reason that it is not resolved.
A promise may be in one of 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected or pending.

6- Application program interface(API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building
software applications.
An API specifies how software components should interact.

7- JacaScript has events to provide a dynamic inerface to a webpage.These events are hooked to 
elements in the DOM, and trough events that occur when the user or the browser manipulates a page.

8- Event bubbling-When an event happens on an element, it first runs the handlers on it, then
on its parent, then all the way up on other ancestors.
